"Programmer's Notepad" is a text editor that is packaged with the devkitPro installer.
We will use it to view and edit the source code to our GBA game.
</p>

<p>
While "Programmer's Notepad" is convenient because it is already installed for as part
of the devkitPro installation, you should feel free to use whatever text editor you
prefer.

# =================================================================
STEP Launch Programmer's Notepad
# =================================================================

<p>
The easiest way to launch Programmer's Notepad is to find the <tt>.pnproj</tt>
file in your project's directory. This file is automatically generated
by Spritely when you "Export" your project.
</p>

<p>
After double-clicking this file, Programmer's Notepad will load your
project:
</p>

<p>
The project source files are shown in a window on the left side.
These are the files that are used to build your GBA project. You'll be
editing these files in later tutorials.
</p>

<p>
If you see extra windows open in Programmer's Notepad, feel free to close
them to reduce clutter.
</p>

# =================================================================
STEP Edit a source file
# =================================================================

<p>
To open a source file, just double-click on the icon next to the filename.
</p>

<p>
To make the window so that it fills the entire workspace, press the "Maximize" button
in the upper-right corner of the window.
</p>

<p>
This will allow you to see more of the file at a time (which makes it easier to make
changes to the code).

# =================================================================
STEP Build/Run from within Programmer's Notepad
# =================================================================

<p>
One nice feature of "Programmer's Notepad" is that you can build and run your GBA project
easily without switching to another application.
</p>

<p>
To build your project, select "make" from the "Tools" menu.
</p>

IMAGE menu_make.png

<p>
This will open up an "Output" window at the bottom of the workspace and automatically
enter the make command for you.
</p>

IMAGE output_small.png

<p>
The output of the <tt>make</tt> command will be displayed in this output window.
</p>

<p>
If you see
</p>

<pre class="code">
ROM fixed!
</pre>

<p>for GBA projects, or</p>

<pre class="code">
build ... mygame.nds
</pre>

<p>for NDS projects, or a message that ends with</p>

<pre class="code">
... is up to date.
</pre>

<p>
at the end of the ouput, then your project was built successfully.
</p>

<p>
To run your program after it's built, select "run" from the "Tools" menu.
</p>

IMAGE menu_run.png

<p>
If you've already made the file association (as shown in
TUTORIAL_LINK run_gba_rom Running your GBA ROM
tutorial), then this will automatically launch VisualBoy Advance with your ROM.
</p>

FINISH

<p>
That's all.
