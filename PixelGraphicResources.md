# Pixel Graphic Resources.

## Introduction

This page lists a variety of resources that you can use while creating
graphics for your game. Some of these sites have images that you can use
in your game for free while others can be used as examples and
inspiration - please read any release notes before including someone
else's graphics into your program!

 
## Tutorials & Guides

These references show you how to create your own bitmap graphics.

Ari Feldman's
*[Designing Arcade Computer Game Graphics](http://www.phatcode.net/res/269/files/dacgg.pdf)*
was published back in 2000 but is now out of print. However, you can download a
complete PDF of the book.

 
## Free Sprites

Many sprites are freely available for you to use in your
games. They are typically in the form of a single "sprite sheet", which is a
single PNG or BMP file with all the sprites arranged on them. To use these with
Spritely, you'll need to redraw them within Spritely.

To find them, do an [image search for "sprite sheet"](https://www.google.com/search?q=sprite+sheet).

## Commercial Sprites & Background Maps

If you're planning on releasing your game, you cannot make use of these sprite
sets since most/all of them were extracted from commercial game releases (or
involve copyrighted characters). However, they're a great source of inspiration
and allow you to see how the professionals create and animate their sprites.

[Video Game Maps](http://www.vgmaps.com/) has a number of background maps extracted from
different games. This is a great reference when you're creating your own background maps.
